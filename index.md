## About me

![Octocat](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png)

  Hai, I'm Vyshak Puthusseri. Completed my Master's degree in Computer Applications at College of Engineering Trivandrum, India as a class topper.  My dream is to build something that can solve at least some uncertainty.

## Currently
  Now as a part-time, I work as a Chegg Expert. And I have to give answers to the questions that the users will ask. I usually answer questions related to programming( Mainly python) and data structures. 


## Projects which was done for just studying

* **ScrapTripAdvisor** [2019] <br />
Generate some insights by scrapping the website.

* **ScrapUberEats** [2019] <br />
This was done to find out where to get the best biriyani.
We need to input the link of the Uber Eats page which already selects the location and the food item.
After scrapping we will extract the reviews of the restaurant and that food wad will try to rank it.

* **FaceRecoganizedAttendence** [2019] <br />
Trained a deep neural network using CNN that can identify the face of my classmates. The data was collected by taking around 10 images of each of my classmates and label it with their names.

* **Generate TV Scripts** [2019]<br />
The project was done for the Udacity deep learning nano degree. It generates a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network."

* **Car Racing** [2019]<br />
Racing stimulation build using the Unity3D game engine

* **InstaPostDnld** [2018] <br />
It helps to download all the images of an Instagram profile. Used BeadutifulSoup for scrapping. Done for my friend to help to collect photos of her boyfriend to give him a birthday surprise.

* **VR Video Player** [2018] <br />
Used the Unity 3d game engine for doing. The result built into an android application. Used google VR Tool kit for VR associated libraries.
