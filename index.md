## Projects

* **Generate Faces** [2019]<br />
The project was done for the udacity deeplearning nanodegree. Define two adversarial networks, a generator and discriminator, and train them until realistic faces can be generated."

* **Generate TV Scripts** [2019]<br />
The project was done for the udacity deeplearning nanodegree. It generate a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network."

* **Dog-Breed Classifier** [2019]<br />
The project was done for the udacity deeplearning nanodegree. Build a CNN model from the scratch."

* **Predicting BikeSharing patterns** [2019]<br />
The project was done for the udacity deeplearning nanodegree. The model was trained using by creating the neuralnetwork without using ML libraries. The computations are done using the numpy. Dataset used was "Bike Sharing Dataset from UCI ML repository"

* **Kerala Tourism VR** [2019]<br />
It was a VR application which helps in Kerala Tousism. Created for the Facebook School of Innovation VR101 awareness programme.

* **Car Racing** [2019]<br />
Racing stimulation build using the Unity3D game engine

* **InstaPostDnld** [2018] <br />
It helps to download all the images of an Instagram profile.Used BeadutifulSoup for scrapping.

* **A novel approach for classification using clustering** [2017] <br />
A case study on heart disease prediction to improve the accuracy of classification algorithms.
